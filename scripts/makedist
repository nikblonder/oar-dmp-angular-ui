# makedist:  build the package's distributions
#
# This script is designed to run without any arguments: this will build
# all of the available distributions.  Restricting the build to specific
# distributions can be done by listing the names of the desired distributions
# on the command line.
#
# This script is a simple wrapper around makedist.angular; see that script
# for further details (or type "makedist -h")
